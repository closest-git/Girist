TV_L1: morphological invariance and texture extraction by scale
[ref] A comparison of three total variation based texture extraction models

Texture is characterizedas repeated and meaningful structure of small patterns. Noise is characterized
as uncorrelated random patterns
We can interpret Meyer's result as follows. First, no matter how regular f is, u is always different to f as 
long as f!=0. This is a major limitation of the ROF model, but it can be relaxed by applying
the ROF model iteratively [17] or use the inverse TV flow [7]. Second, the texture/noise output v has its
G-norm given by min{0.5*lenda?|f|*}. Therefore, the oscillating signal with G-norm less than 0.5*lenda
 is removed by the ROF model. 

the solution v of the TV-L1 model can be much smaller. In other words, the TV-L1 may not always remove some
oscillating signal from f and erode the structure.

Refinement equation(MFA Equation) is fundamental to multiresolution analysi.
It states that the expansion fucntions of any subspace can be built from double-resolution copies of themselves-that is,from expasnion fuctions of the next higher resolution space.
